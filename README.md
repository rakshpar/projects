Determining the degree of damage that is done to buildings post an earthquake can help identify safe and unsafe buildings, thus avoiding death and injuries resulting from aftershocks.  Leveraging the power of machine learning is one viable option that can potentially prevent massive loss of lives while simultaneously making rescue efforts easy and efficient.

applied gradient boosting using XGBoost

converted qualitative variables to numeric values using one hot encoding

<b><a href="https://github.com/rakshpar/projects/blob/master/walmart%20sales%20forcasting/walmart_final.ipynb">Walmart Sales Forcasting</a></b>

historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

applied LSTM with drop out rate of 0.2 and 3 layers

predicted avarege weekly sales offset by 1700 with 5 fold cross-validtion

We can improve the campaign success by showing the campaigns to the clients who will subscribe a term deposit. 
since data is imbalanced, undersampling was carried out before building models. After
preprocessing the data, we build logistic regression and measured AUC score and lift chart.

We get the AUC score of 74 percent.
